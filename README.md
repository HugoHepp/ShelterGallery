HugoHepp - CS50 - Final project: Shelter-Gallery

Shelter-Gallery is a platform that centralizes animals from different shelters on a single website.

Shelter owners can register, create animal profiles and delete them after successful adoption.
Shelters will only be able to manage animals registered with their respective accounts

The user does not need an account. He simply makes a search request on the home page by choosing his city from the list and the desired animal species.
(The query form only displays cities with registered animals.)

The website will sort the animals by city and species and display them to the user.
Users have access to animal photos and more information.
